Using Unity, the goal was to create an experience similar to the VR game "Richies Plank Experience", using the study as a theme. <br>
It was to be used as show-off project in open days of the university. <br>
This project was also the first time working on a VR application for each of our team members.
<br>
<br>
To make this experience more immersive, players were made to stand on a real plank, while playing this game in VR goggles.

## Fencing against a Pirate
Standing on a plank of their ship in the ocean, the player needs to defend themselves against a pirate.<br>
If they fail to parry the incoming attacks or lose balance, they fall into the ocean.

## Painting
Standing on a scaffold inside a church, the player needs to color the picture infront of them.<br>
Within four minutes, they are supposed to colour it with what is available to their own liking.<br>
If they lose balance, they fall off the scaffold onto the ground of the church.

## Game Over Room
If they lose a minigame, by falling of their respective planks, the player is brought into an empty space.<br>
Touching the light within the green area brings them back to the lobby they're already familiar with.
